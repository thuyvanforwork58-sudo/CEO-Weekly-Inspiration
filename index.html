  <p>Team,</p>
  <p>I hope this Sunday finds you well and reflecting on the incredible opportunities we have ahead of us. Stick with your daily rituals and routines and become a better version of yourself every day.</p>
  <p>This week, I want to share something that completely shifted my perspective, thanks to a book written by one of our own team members, <strong>Drew Maddux</strong> from Ashley Global Retail. Drew shared his book "Get2" with me, and the story behind it is both powerful and transformative.</p>
  <p>When Drew was in college, he was going through a "suffering mindset"-complaining about his classes, his workload, and all the things he felt he "had to" do. During one of his weekly calls with his grandfather, he was venting about how difficult everything was in school and how much he was struggling with his workload and responsibilities.</p>
  <p>His grandfather, who was battling cancer and spending many hours each week in chemotherapy, was disappointed in Drew and said something that changed his life forever. He told Drew that he was upset with his attitude because Drew had the incredible <span class="highlight-low">privilege</span> of "<span class="highlight-low">getting to</span>" do all these things. While his grandfather was fighting just to survive, Drew had the <span class="highlight-low">choice</span> to pursue an education, to build his future, and to <span class="highlight-low">make an impact</span>. His grandfather reminded him that these weren't burdens-they were <span class="highlight-low">gifts</span>.</p>
  <p>This story hit me hard because it highlights something we all need to remember, having a <span class="highlight-low">mindset of gratitude, growth, and abundance</span> is an amazing gift we can give to ourselves, our families, and our associates.</p>
  <p>Think about your own life right now. You don't "have to" come to work-you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" contribute to building something incredible. You don't "have to" deal with challenging customers-you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" <span class="highlight-low">solve problems and create value</span>. You don't "have to" learn new skills-you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" <span class="highlight-low">expand your capabilities</span>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This shift from "have to" to "get to" isn't just about positive thinking - it's about recognizing the <span class="highlight-low">privilege</span> and <span class="highlight-low">opportunity</span> in everything we do.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When you realize you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" be part of this team, you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" work on <span class="highlight-low">meaningful projects</span>, you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" <span class="highlight-low">make a difference</span> in people's lives through the work we do, it changes everything about how you approach each day.</p>
  <p>I also want to share something else that reinforced this message. Suzanne Cisco sent me an article written by her son Kobe about successful people who may have been underachievers in school but had the "<span class="highlight-low">motor</span>" to excel because they were hungry for growth. Kobe talks about the importance of "<span class="highlight-low">owning</span>" things and being <span class="highlight-low">responsible</span>-taking complete <span class="highlight-low">ownership</span> of your <span class="highlight-low">attitude</span>, your <span class="highlight-low">effort</span>, and your <span class="highlight-low">results</span> rather than making excuses or blaming circumstances.</p>
  <p>This connects perfectly with Drew's message. When you're grateful that you "<span class="highlight-low">get to</span>" do something, you naturally take more ownership of it. When you see opportunity instead of obligation, you bring more <span class="highlight-low">energy, creativity, and commitment</span> to everything you do.</p>
  <p>I challenge each of you this week to <span class="highlight-high">change your internal dialogue</span>. Instead of thinking "I have to go to this meeting," think "<span class="highlight-low">I get to</span> contribute ideas and help solve problems." Instead of "I have to deal with this difficult situation," think "<span class="highlight-low">I get to</span> demonstrate my problem-solving skills and make things better." Instead of "I have to learn this new technology," think "<span class="highlight-low">I get to</span> <span class="highlight-low">expand my capabilities</span> and <span class="highlight-low">become more valuable</span>."</p>
  <p>This isn't just about being positive-it's about recognizing the incredible privilege to work on <span class="highlight-low">meaningful challenges</span> with an <span class="highlight-low">amazing team</span>. While others are struggling just to find employment, we get to be part of something that's growing, innovating, and making a real impact.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight-high">You can choose gratitude over complaint.</span> <span class="highlight-high">You can choose growth over comfort.</span> <span class="highlight-high">You can choose abundance thinking over scarcity thinking.</span></p>
  <p><span class="highlight-high">Most importantly, you can choose to be grateful that you "get to" do things every day - whether they're small tasks or major projects.</span> Be honored that you have these opportunities. Make the right choices in your life and change your "shoulds" to "musts."</p>
  <p>Thank you to Drew for sharing his story and book with me, and to Suzanne for sharing Kobe's insights about ownership and having the "motor" to excel. These reminders of perspective and responsibility are exactly what we all need to hear.</p>

    <strong>Try this:</strong> Write one sentence starting with <em>"I get to..."</em> about a task you've been avoiding. Read it aloud. Notice the shift in energy.
