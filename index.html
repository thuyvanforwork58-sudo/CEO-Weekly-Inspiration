    <div class="date">October 13, 2025</div>

  <p>Team,</p>
  <p>I want to wish you a Happy Gratitude Sunday. It is an amazing day in Wisconsin, great weather, and an awesome day to be alive and thriving. Great day to stay focused and rigorous on your rituals and routines.</p>

  <p>I want to talk about a simple but powerful truth: <span class="highlight-high">we get what we focus on</span>. Our lives today are a direct result of the choices and the focus we had yesterday. Our future will be a direct result of the choices and the focus we have today.</p>

  <p>It's easy to get pulled into the negativity happening around us—the news, the economy, the constant stream of problems. You can let that noise dictate your mindset, and if you do, you’ll slip into a <span class="highlight-low">scarcity mentality</span>, always feeling like you're behind or that things are happening to you.</p>

  <p>But we have a choice. We can choose to be a victim of our circumstances, complaining about the challenges and focusing on what's wrong. Or, we can choose to be a <span class="highlight-high">victor</span>, focusing on the incredible abundance of opportunities we have, taking ownership of our attitude, and creating the outcomes we want.</p>

  <p>The single most powerful tool for choosing to be a victor is <span class="highlight-high">gratitude</span>. This isn't just about feeling good. Research from top universities proves that gratitude literally rewires your brain. People who consistently practice it sleep better, handle stress more effectively, and maintain a more positive and resilient attitude. Gratitude trains your mind to spot opportunities instead of fixating on obstacles.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gratitude is most powerful not when life is easy—but when life is hard. Champions learn to be grateful during the struggle. That is <span class="highlight-low">mental toughness</span>. That is how you <span class="highlight-low">build resilience</span>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This victor mindset is fueled by your <span class="highlight-low">health</span> and your <span class="highlight-low">attitude</span>. When you choose to prioritize your physical health—through good food, consistent exercise, and quality sleep—you create the raw energy needed to maintain a positive attitude and execute at a high level. You can't have a world-class life with a second-class attitude and well-being.</p>

  <p>At Ashley, we are surrounded by massive opportunities, but only if we choose to see them.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We don't have to deal with changing customer expectations; we <span class="highlight-low">get to</span> use our scale and talent to serve them better than anyone else in the world.</li>
    <li>We don't have to figure out AI and automation; we <span class="highlight-low">get to</span> embrace these incredible tools to build a competitive moat and make our work more meaningful and productive.</li>
    <li>We don't have to build a better culture; we <span class="highlight-low">get to</span> serve our employees by creating the best place to work in our industry, where people can truly flourish.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have a great plan and great people in our company. The future is unbelievably bright, but we must be excited about creating it. We must choose to see the abundance of opportunities in front of us instead of the scarcity of problems.</p>

  <p>So, this week, I challenge you to make a conscious choice. When you face a problem, choose to focus on the solution. When you feel stressed, choose to move your body and clear your mind. When you wake up, choose to be grateful for the opportunities you have in your life.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="highlight-high">Don't be a victim. Be a victor.</span> Your career, your happiness, and your future depend on the choices you make every single day.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We will continue to “pivot” and adjust to the changing environment and our commitment to having the best operations to support our customers. <span class="highlight-high">We MUST be a Victor…</span></p>

  <p>Have an awesome week,</p>
